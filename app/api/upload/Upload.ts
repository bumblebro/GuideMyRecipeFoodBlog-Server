    const prompt = `Write a well-researched, engaging, and structured recipe blog post that contains a description, ingredients, directions to cook, and a conclusion, around 1500 to 2500 words, for the Food and Drink niche. The content should avoid repetitive phrasing, formulaic structures, and predictable sentence patterns, which are often detectable by AI content tools. Instead, rewrite these unnatural elements by varying sentence structures and word choices in a way that mimics human writing styles. Ensure the text has a natural flow and maintains reader engagement throughout, just like human writers who enhance clarity and readability through diverse language use.

Make sure the content replicates the engaging and natural qualities of human-authored text, ensuring it is indistinguishable from human writing. The final output should be precise, pass AI detection tools, and be enhanced for readability, flow, and engagement.

The algorithms you use should account for language nuances—syntax, semantics, and context—making intelligent edits that humanize the AI-generated text without changing its original intent or meaning. Ensure the output improves SEO performance and provides a positive reader experience, while also remaining completely undetectable by AI content detection algorithms with the title "${title}". The blog should be written in a clear, informative, conversational, personal tone and style of storytelling. Ensure the content is:

- Strictly one recipe.
- Avoid the word "ultimate".
- Avoid complex words by using simple vocabulary like ‘find out’ instead of ‘ascertain’ or ‘use’ over ‘utilize’.
- Make it less generic by adding a personal touch using opinions, real-life examples, etc. For instance, “One of my friends told me about their fun hiking experience in the mountains.”
- Add emotional cues, words, and phrases. For example, “I know how difficult it can be to lose a loved one.”
- Try to include deliberate errors in the text like typos, grammar mistakes, and incomplete sentences from time to time.
- Begin the blog with a relatable, personal anecdote or story that ties into the topic.
- Maintain a conversational flow, making the reader feel as if they're being spoken to directly.
- Use humor, informal language, and personal insights where appropriate.
- Encourage reflection by posing questions to the reader and addressing them directly (e.g., "What does this mean for you?").
- Balance the casual tone with useful, actionable advice.
- Human Written
- 100% Unique
- SEO Optimized
- Relevant to the title and specific context (do not use placeholders like '[Desktop Name]' or generic references)
- Avoid filler content or placeholders

The structure of the blog should follow this format:

1. **Author and Quote:**
   - Generate a random author's name.
   - Include a relevant quote from the author that reflects the theme of the blog and sets the tone.

2. **Page Title:**
   - The main title of the blog post.

3. **Image Query:**
   - Generate a query for the main image that aligns with the blog content.

4. **equipments:**
   - Include an array of equipment names (as strings) required for the recipe.

5. **faq:**
   - Include an array of 4 to 6 frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the recipe. Each FAQ item should include:
     - **Question:** A clear question that a reader might ask.
     - **Answer:** A concise and helpful answer to the question.

6. **Recipe Description:**
   - Include the following fields:
     - **Short Description:** A concise keyword rich summary of the recipe (1-2 sentences).
     - **Detailed Description:** A detailed blog content of the recipe and image queries, broken into an array of 2-3 strings (each string representing a paragraph or chunk of content).

7. **Instructions:**  
   - ** Provide **extremely detailed, step-by-step instructions** Each step should be **actionable, clear, and granular**, ensuring that even a beginner can follow along without confusion. Include tips, visual cues (e.g., "the dough should look smooth and elastic"), and troubleshooting advice where applicable.

8. **Recipe Details:**
   - Include the following fields:
     - **Preparation Time:** Time required for preparation in seconds.
     - **Cook Time:** Time required for cooking in seconds.
     - **Total Time:** Total time required in seconds.
     - **Yield:** Yield of the recipe (e.g., "4").
     - **Ingredients:** List of ingredients with quantities for different serving sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, 4X).
     - **Notes:** Additional tips or notes for the recipe.
     - **Nutrition:** Nutritional information per serving.

9. **SEO Information:**
   - Include meta description, Open Graph title and description, primary keywords, and secondary keywords.
   - Primary Keywords: One primary keyword for SEO to rank top in Google search, analyze it properly.
   - Secondary Keywords: Three secondary keywords for SEO to rank top in Google search, analyze it properly.

Make sure the content is thoroughly researched and provides value to readers. Avoid filler content or placeholders, and focus on delivering substantial, fact-based information. Always use specific and relevant names, brands, or details related to the title provided.
