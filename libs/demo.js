  instructions: [
    "First, prepare the aromatics. Finely chop one medium onion, two cloves of garlic, and one inch of ginger.  Don't be afraid to really mince that garlic - the more the merrier, I say!",
    "Heat two tablespoons of coconut oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent burning.  This is super important - nobody likes burnt onions!",
    "Next, add the minced garlic and ginger to the pot.  Cook for another minute, until fragrant. Stir constantly to prevent burning!",
    "Now it's time for the spices! Add one tablespoon of curry powder, one teaspoon of turmeric, one-half teaspoon of cumin, one-half teaspoon of coriander, and a pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for heat). Cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant.  This step releases the amazing aromas of the spices!",
    "Add 1 (14.5-ounce) can of diced tomatoes, undrained,  one (15-ounce) can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained, and 4 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Let the flavors meld, it makes all the difference in the world!",
    "After 20 minutes, stir in 1 (13.5-ounce) can of full-fat coconut milk and 5 ounces of fresh spinach. Continue to simmer until the spinach has wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally.  Don't overcook the spinach, or it'll get mushy!",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings.  Add more salt, pepper, or any other spices to your liking. Remember, cooking is all about personal preferences!",
    "Serve hot. Garnish with fresh cilantro (optional), a squeeze of lime, and a dollop of plain yogurt or coconut cream (optional). This part is purely for show, but the show looks amazing!",
